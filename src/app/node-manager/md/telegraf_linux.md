# Telegraf for Linux: Monitoring and Data Collection Guide

## What is Telegraf?

**Telegraf** is a lightweight, open-source agent for collecting, processing, and exporting metrics and events from various sources. It supports multiple protocols and plugins, allowing users to efficiently monitor systems, network devices, and services. The Linux version of Telegraf provides powerful tools for monitoring Linux hosts and interacting with devices and protocols like **IPMI**, **SNMP**, **SNMP Traps**, **HTTP**, and **Ping**.

## Key Use Cases for Telegraf on Linux

With Telegraf, you can achieve the following monitoring tasks and scenarios:

1. **Linux Host Monitoring**:
   - Collect system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, processes).
   - Use Linux-specific data sources like systemd logs, or process-based monitoring.

2. **IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)**:
   - Collect hardware and sensor data from servers using the **ipmi_sensor** input plugin.

3. **SNMP Monitoring**:
   - Monitor switches, routers, and other network devices with the SNMP protocol.
   - Supports both polling SNMP metrics and receiving **SNMP Traps**.

4. **HTTP Monitoring**:
   - Interact with HTTP endpoints to monitor API health or service availability.

5. **Ping Monitoring**:
   - Measure network connectivity and latency via the **ping** plugin.

With its modular plugin architecture, Telegraf can integrate multiple data collection mechanisms into a single monitoring agent.

## Installing Telegraf on Linux

1. **Install sidecar**
   - Install the sidecar for the corresponding node in the "cloud region". This ensures the node is prepared for monitoring and management.

2. **Add configuration**
   - Add the corresponding Telegraf configuration file in the "cloud region" and apply it to the Linux node to enable the Telegraf agent.
